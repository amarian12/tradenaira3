				<h4> <b>IMPORTANT INFORMATION – KEY RISKS AND TERMS</b></h4>
				  <div class="panel panel-default">
					<p><b>This is an important document which you must consider carefully when choosing whether to use the Services at any time. Please read the terms of this Agreement carefully before agreeing to it. This Agreement also highlights certain risks on using the Services together with guidance on how to safely carry out online payments via TradeNAIRA.com.</b></p>

					<p> <b>You are solely responsible for understanding and complying with any and all laws, rules and regulations of your specific jurisdiction that may be applicable to you in connection with your use of the Services, including but not limited to, those related to regulated activity, licensed activity, export or import activity, taxes or foreign currency transactions.</b></p>

					<p><b>Please note the following risks and key terms applicable to your use of the Services:</b></p>
					<h5><b>Risk of payment reversals</b></h5>
					<p><b>Payments received in your TradeNAIRA.com Account may be reversed at a later time, for example, if such a payment is subject to a Chargeback, Reversal, Claim or otherwise invalidated. This means that for some of our sellers, payments received into their Account may be returned to the sender or otherwise removed from their Account after they have been paid and/or delivered any goods or services sold.</b></p>

					<p><b>A key eligibility requirement of the Seller Protection Programme is that, for tangible items, the seller must post the item to the address which appears on the transaction details page. If the item is delivered in person or if a seller posts the item to a different address (for example, if the buyer asks that you send to another address on the basis that it is a “work address” or a “gift” address) then you will not be eligible for re-imbursement under the terms of the programme.</b></p>

					<p><b>You can help protect yourself from the risks of a payment being reversed from your Account by following the criteria set out in the TradeNAIRA.com Seller Protection Programme and by following the other guidance provided to sellers as set out in the "Security Centre" accessible via most pages of the TradeNAIRA.com website.</b></p>

					<p><b>We may close, suspend, or limit your access to your Account or our Services, and/or limit access to your funds to the extent and for so long as reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability (see section 10.2h) if you violate this Agreement including the TradeNAIRA.com Acceptable Use Policy, or any other agreement you enter into with TradeNAIRA.com. For the avoidance of doubt, we may permanently block your account for breach of section 10.6 (Information about you).</b></p>
					
					<p><b>Risk of payments being held by TradeNAIRA.com</b></p>

					<p><b>Please note that although you may only have one TradeNAIRA.com Account, your Account has two separate and distinct functionalities, the payment functionality and the reserve functionality. Your ability to access funds in your Account and to execute payment transactions from your Account will depend upon which functionality the funds are subject to at any given time. For the purposes of this Agreement:</b></p>
					<ul>
					<li><b>The element of your Account which constitutes the payment functionality will be known as the "Payment Account". The Payment Account is the operational part of your Account through which you have access to funds and which can be used for the execution of payment transactions.</b></li>
					<li><b>The element of your Account which constitutes the reserve functionality will be known as the "Reserve Account". Your access to the Reserve Account is restricted and you have no ability to access funds in the Reserve Account or to execute payment transactions over funds in the Reserve Account. Funds held in the Reserve Account may be marked, for example, "Pending", "Uncleared", "Held".</b></li>
					</ul>
					<p><b>Examples of when funds may be held by TradeNAIRA.com to mitigate risks include when those funds are subject to:</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Merchant processing delay (see section 4.7)</b></li>
						<li><b>Reserve (see section 10.4)</b></li>
						<li><b>Payment review (see section 5.2)</b></li>
						<li><b>Payment Hold (see section 10.5)</b></li>
						<li><b>Restricted Activity and actions taken by TradeNAIRA.com (see sections 9 and 10)</b></li>
					</ul>
					<h5><b>Disputes</b></h5>
					<p><b>If you wish to open a Dispute through TradeNAIRA.com’s Resolution Centre you must do so within 180 days of making your payment.</b></p>
					<h5><b>Payment executionM</b></h5>
					<p><b>Please note that TradeNAIRA.com will execute a valid Payment Order made by you through your Payment Account and credit the payment service provider of the person to whom you are sending your payment as soon as the payment schemes available to TradeNAIRA.com allow (which can be within the next Business Day) following the date you gave us your valid Payment Order. This execution time is subject to certain conditions and more detail around execution of Payment Orders is set out in section 4.1 of this Agreement.</b></p>

				                <li><b>Eligibility</b></li> 
				                <p>To be eligible for our Services, you must (i) have full legal capacity to enter into a contract; and (ii) if you are an individual, be at least 18 years old. You further represent and warrant to us in opening an Account with us that you are not acting on behalf of, or for the benefit of, anyone else, unless you are opening the Account for and under the direction of the company that employs you. If you are not acting for the company that employs you, the new Account must be in your own name only. This Agreement applies only to Users who are residents of the United Kingdom and Relevant Countries. If you are a resident of another country, you may access your agreement from the TradeNAIRA.com website(s) in your country (if applicable). </p>  
				        </ol>

				    </li>
				    <li><b>Your Account and Balances</b>
				        <ol>
				            <li><b>Personal and Business Accounts.</b></li>
				            <p>We offer the following types of Accounts: Personal and Business Accounts. Unless otherwise agreed, you may hold not more than one Personal Account and one Business Account. Holders of certain Personal Accounts may be required to upgrade their accounts (which may include providing further information to TradeNAIRA.com) in order to use all of the current functionality available in a Personal Account. By opening a Business Account and accepting the terms as outlined in this Agreement, you attest that you are not establishing the Account primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. You agree that your Account comprises the Payment Account and the Reserve Account.</p>
				            <li><b>Balance</b></li>
				            <p>The Balance in your Account represents the amount of E-money available for paying out from your Account, subject to the terms of this Agreement. If you hold a Balance you will not receive interest or any other earnings on the Balance because European law forbids paying interest on E-Money, as it is a cash-equivalent and not a deposit.</p>
				            <p>You are not required to keep a Balance at all times, but if you use the Service to pay another User you need to have sufficient Balance in your Account to cover the amount of the payment (and transaction fees payable to us).</p>
				            <p>This is because, when you pay another User, <b>you are authorising us to transfer E-money from your Balance to the Account of the recipient, in each case according to your Payment Order and subject to the terms of this Agreement.</b> </p>
				            <p>To get a Balance on your Account you can, subject further to this Agreement:</p>
				            	<ul>
				            		<li>accept a payment in your Account from someone else; or</li>
				            		<li>obtain E-money from us by paying us an equivalent amount. You can do this:
				            			<ol>
				            				<ul>
				            				<li>automatically using your applicable Funding Source(s) to cover payments that you instruct us to send to other Users (and the transaction fees payable by you to us). The execution of the payment from your bank or card issuer to TradeNAIRA.com is your bank’s/card issuer’s responsibility; or</li>
				            				<li>manually using the Add Funds function available from your Account interface to pay us or instructing us to pull a payment from your bank account under the authority you give us when linking your bank account as a Funding Source (see section 3.3).</li>
				            				</ul>
				            			</ol>
				            		</li>
				            	</ul>
				            <li><b>Account information (including Balance and transaction information)</b></li>
				            <p>Unless your Account is restricted, you may access your details of executed payment transactions and other information relating to your Account transaction history and Balance by logging into your Account. Key information relating to your payments will be provided to you via e-mail and your transaction history will also be updated and made available to you at any time by logging into your Account. You will also be able to access a downloadable report via the “History” section of your Account. The “History” section will also show all Fees incurred and any other amounts charged to your Account in the relevant period. The “History” will only be updated and made available if there has been any activity on your Account or any Fees have been incurred in the relevant period. TradeNAIRA.com reserves the right to charge a Fee for providing you with additional information or for providing the transaction history and other information about Fees in a different way. The way in which we provide the transaction information will allow you to store and reproduce the information unchanged, for example by printing a copy. TradeNAIRA.com will ensure that the details of each transaction will be made available for you to view online for at least 13 months from when it is first made available. You agree to review your transactions through your Account History instead of receiving periodic statements by mail. </p>
				            <li><b>Set-off</b></li>
				            <p>You agree that we may set-off any of the amounts held in Accounts held or controlled by you with any fees, charges or other amounts you owe us and (unless prevented by insolvency law) any such amounts you owe other members of the TradeNAIRA.com Group (including, without limitation, in respect of any services provided by any member of the TradeNAIRA.com Group). In simple terms, our right to set-off means that we may deduct such fees, charges or other amounts mentioned in this section from an Account Balance held or controlled by you.</p>
				            <li><b>Amounts you owe us.</b></li>
				            <p> Where the aggregate amount you owe us exceeds the amount held in your Balance we may show your Balance in negative figures as a reflection of the net amount you owe to us.</p>
				            <li><b>Balances in Multiple Currencies</b></li>
				            <p>If one of the currency Balances in your Account shows that you owe us an amount of funds for any reason, we may set-off the amount you owe us by using funds you maintain in a different currency Balance or by deducting amounts you owe us from money you receive into your Account, or money you attempt to withdraw or send from your Account, or in a different Account, and by deducting funds from any withdrawals you attempt to make. If, for a period of 21 Days, you have a Balance that reflects an amount owing to us that is not in USD, TradeNAIRA.com will convert the amount you owe us to USD. You will be charged a Currency Conversion Fee as for the conversion of the amount you owe us into USD.
							You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining Balances in multiple currencies (including, without limitation, the risk that the value of these Balances will fluctuate as exchange rates change, which over time may result in a significant decrease in the value of the Balances). You agree that you will not attempt to use multiple currencies for speculative trading.</p>
				            <li><b>Security Interest</b></li>
				            <p>To secure your performance of this Agreement, you grant to TradeNAIRA.com a legal claim against the funds in your Account as security for any amount you may owe to us. This is known in legal terms as a “lien” on and “security interest” in your Account.</p>
				        </ol>
				    </li>
				    <li><b>Funding Sources</b>
				    <ol>
				    	<li><b>Linking your Funding Source.</b></li>
				    	<p>You can link or unlink a debit card, a credit card, a pre-paid card (in certain cases), a bank account and/or TradeNAIRA.com Credit as a Funding Source for your Account.   Please keep your Funding Source information current (i.e. credit card number and expiration date). If this information changes, we may update it at our sole discretion without any action on your part, according to information provided by your bank or card issuer and third parties (including but not limited to our financial services partners and the card networks). If you do not want us to update your Funding Source information, you may contact your bank or card issuer to request this or remove the Funding Source in your Account Profile. If we update your Funding Source information, we may retain any preference setting attached to it.</p>
				    	<p>You may choose to confirm your card or bank account, so that we can verify that the card or bank account is valid and that you are its owner. We may allow you to do this by following the Link and Confirm Card process (for cards) or the Bank Confirmation process (for bank accounts) or other processes which we may notify to you or which we may publish from time to time.</p>
				    	<li><b>Cards.</b></li>
				    	<p> By linking a debit card, credit card or (in certain cases) pre-paid card as a Funding Source, you are providing TradeNAIRA.com with a continuous authority to automatically charge that card for the amount necessary to purchase E-money required in your Balance to cover a Payment Order (plus transaction fees payable to us) when the card is the applicable Funding Source for that Payment Order pursuant to this Agreement. You can stop the continuous authority in respect of any card by removing that card as a Funding Source in your Account Profile.</p>
				    	<li><b>Bank accounts.</b></li>
				    	<p>By linking your bank account as a Funding Source, you are providing TradeNAIRA.com with a continuous authority (subject to the terms of the mandate used by your bank to set up and maintain that authority) to automatically charge your bank account for the amount necessary to purchase E-money in your Balance:</p>
				    	<ul>
				    		<li>required to cover a Payment Order to another User (plus transaction fees payable to us) when the bank account is the applicable Funding Source for that Payment Order pursuant to this Agreement: or</li>
				    		<li>when using the Add Funds functionality in your Account interface.</li>
				    	</ul>
				    	<p>You give TradeNAIRA.com the right to resubmit any debit you authorised that is returned for insufficient or uncollected funds. If you cancel any direct debit (including, without limitation, any SEPA Direct Debit), you agree to reimburse us for the value of any goods or services that you have consumed with the proceeds of that direct debit.</p>
				    	<p>You agree that when TradeNAIRA.com receives a payment from your bank account to obtain E-money in your Account, TradeNAIRA.com may hold the funds in your Reserve Account for so long as TradeNAIRA.com determines that an NSF Risk exists. In such an event, the E-money will not be made available to you in your Payment Account (including for the execution of any Payment Order that the bank payment was made to cover) until TradeNAIRA.com determines that the NSF Risk has passed. Until that time the bank payment will appear to you as “Uncleared” in your Account details. TradeNAIRA.com is not in possession of all the information necessary to place the funds from your bank payment at your disposal until it determines that the NSF Risk has passed. TradeNAIRA.com reserves the right to require you to fund your requested payment by the use of Bank Account - eCheque to mitigate risk (including, without limitation, the NSF Risk) associated with your Payment Order.</p>
				    	</li>
				    	<li>Funding Source Limitations.</li>
				    	<p>In order to manage risk, TradeNAIRA.com may limit the Funding Sources available for a transaction. If we limit a Funding Source, we will alert you that there is a higher than normal level of risk associated with the payment (for example and without limitation, a risk that the payment may be challenged to be unauthorised). Such a notice does not mean that either party to the transaction is acting in a dishonest or fraudulent manner. It means there may be a higher than normal level of risk associated with the payment. Funding Sources may be limited also if you make a TradeNAIRA.com payment through certain third party websites or applications. For TradeNAIRA.com Business Payments, you are limited to funding your TradeNAIRA.com payment with your pre-existing Balance and/or eCheque.</p>	
				    	<p>If your Funding Sources are limited, you may choose to continue with the transaction with the understanding that you may have fewer avenues available for dispute resolution should the transaction turn out to be unsatisfactory (for instance, if one of your Funding Sources is your credit card but, as a result of a limitation of Funding Sources, you cannot fund your TradeNAIRA.com payment by credit card, you will not have chargeback rights for the TradeNAIRA.com payment).</p>
				    </ol>
				    </li>
				    <li><b>Sending Money</b>
				    <ol>
				    	<li><b>Our execution of your Payment Orders.</b>
				    	<p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement (and your compliance with the same), you agree that we will execute a Payment Order made by you via your Payment Account and credit the payment service provider of the person to whom you are sending your payment, as soon as the payment schemes available to TradeNAIRA.com allow (which can be within the next Business Day) following the date you gave us and we received your valid Payment Order. This is subject to you providing us with:</p>
				    		<ol>
				    			<ul>
				    			<li>correct Unique Identifier or other valid details of the recipient or you as TradeNAIRA.com or the person you are paying may reasonably request from you when you complete the details to make the Payment Order;</li>
				    			<li> all mandatory information requested in the relevant payment or checkout flows;</li>
				    			<li>(if required), details of your valid Funding Source(s) that have sufficient funds to make the payment;</li>
				    			<li>valid consent to authorise your Payment Order, such valid consent is provided when you:
				    				<ol>
				    					<ul>
				    						<li>click the “Pay” or “Continue” or other button in the sections of the TradeNAIRA.com website(s) or TradeNAIRA.com checkouts which permit you to send us a Payment Order after you have submitted your correct log-in information (e.g. e-mail and password) and successfully logged into your TradeNAIRA.com Account; and/or</li>
				    						<li> have set up a third party initiated payment Authorisation in which you have agreed with a merchant or other third party to provide an advance Authorisation to allow that merchant or third party to collect payment of funds from your TradeNAIRA.com Account; and/or</li>
				    						<li>instruct us to make a payment in any other way which we may notify to you when making the Payment Order from time to time.</li>
				    					</ul>
				    				</ol>
				    				</li>

				    			</ul>
				    		</ol>
				    		</li>
				    	<li><b>Your Payment Order for a payment to another User</b></li>
				    	<p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, your Payment Order for a payment to another User (whether a Personal Transaction payment or a Commercial Transaction payment) is your instruction and authorisation to us to transfer E-money from the Payment Account element of your Balance to that User as further directed in your Payment Order. Where you have insufficient Balance or have chosen a Preferred Funding Source you are also requesting us to obtain funds on your behalf from your applicable Funding Source and issue E-money to the Payment Account element of your Balance for your payment to be made.</p>
				    	<li><b>Your Payment Order for a Withdrawal.</b></li>
				    	<p> Subject to the terms of this Agreement, your Payment Order for a withdrawal from your Account is your instruction and authorisation to us to redeem E-money from your Balance. Section 6 further applies to this type of Payment Order.</p>
				    	<li><b>Insufficient Funds in your Balance</b></li>
				    	<p>We are under no obligation to execute your Payment Order if you do not have sufficient funds in your Balance. TradeNAIRA.com reserves the right not to effect a payment made by you until it receives cleared funds (this also means, without limitation, that TradeNAIRA.com is not obliged to settle a refund transaction before having received funding for the original transaction).</p>
				    	<li><b>Sending Limits.</b></li>
				    	<p> If you have a periodic sending limit on your Account, you can view it by logging into your Account and clicking on the “View your account limits” link on the “Account Overview” page. We may, at our reasonable discretion (for example, without limitation, to limit fraud or credit risk), impose limits on the amount of money you can send through our Service. To lift your sending limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your Account Overview).</p>
				    	<li><b>Refused Transactions</b>
				    	<p>When you send E-money, although the E-money is available to the recipient, the recipient is not required to accept it. You agree that you will not hold TradeNAIRA.com liable for any damages resulting from a recipient's decision to not accept a payment made through the Service. We will:</p>
				    	<ol>
				    		<ul>
				    			<li> quickly return any refunded or denied payment to your Balance or as appropriate, your original Funding Source (in some cases instead we may decide to not charge your original Funding Source); and</li>
				    			<li>return any unclaimed payment to your Balance within 30 Days after the date you initiated the payment.</li>
				    		</ul>
				    	</ol>
				    	</li>

				    	<li><b>Merchant Processing Delay.</b>
				    	<p>When you pay certain merchants (for instance, some merchants selling on online platforms) or pay for certain purchases (for instance, purchases which have to be shipped to you or may be further amended by the merchant), you are providing:</p>
				    	<ol>
				    		<ul>
				    			<li>an Authorisation to the merchant to collect your payment at a later time; and</li>
				    			<li>an instruction to TradeNAIRA.com to pay that merchant when the merchant requests payment.</li>
				    		</ul>
				    	</ol>
				    	<p>Your Authorisation will remain valid typically for up to 30 Days. If you have a positive Balance at the time you made your Authorisation, you agree that TradeNAIRA.com may hold the payment amount as pending in your Reserve Account until the merchant collects your payment. If your payment requires a currency conversion by us, the final exchange rate (which includes a Currency Conversion Fee) will be determined and applied (in accordance with section 8.2) at the time the merchant processes your payment and completes the transaction.</p>
				    	<p>Your Authorisation allows the merchant to amend the payment amount before the merchant collects the payment (to account for any amendments to the purchase that you may agree with the merchant, such as additional tax, shipping or postage charges or discounts). TradeNAIRA.com may set a maximum amount for the payment to be made to the merchant in certain circumstances, which may be shown to you on the payment authorisation page. TradeNAIRA.com is not required to verify any amendments at any time (including at the time the payment is transferred). TradeNAIRA.com may transfer any amount on the basis of your Authorisation and upon receiving instructions from the merchant of the final payment amount (subject to any maximum amount set and communicated by TradeNAIRA.com for the given payment.</p>

				    	<li><b>Sending E-money in different currencies.</b>
				    	<p> You may Send Money in U.S. Dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling, Nigerian Naira and Ghanaian Cedi. There may be some restrictions with regard to where you can send certain currencies. When you send money for someone to receive in a currency that is different than the primary currency of your Account, we follow these practices:</p>
				    	<ol>
				    		<ul>
				    			<li>If you have an existing Balance in the receiving currency, we will send your payment from your Balance.</li>
				    			<li>If you have a Balance in a currency different than the receiving currency, we will perform a currency conversion (pursuant to section 8.2) and use the converted Balance to send your payment.</li>
				    			<li>If you do not have any Balance, we will automatically obtain Balance in the primary currency of your Account from the relevant Funding Source pursuant to section 3 to cover your Payment Order (and any Fees you owe us). When you pay us, your Funding Source provider may apply (and may charge you for) any required currency conversion. We will then perform a currency conversion (pursuant to section 8.2) from your primary currency and send your payment (and collect Fees that are payable in the currency in which the payment is received by the recipient) from the converted Balance.</li>
				    		</ul>
				    	</ol>

				    	</li>
				    

				    </ol>
				    </li>
				    <li>Receiving Money
				    <p>TradeNAIRA.com may allow anybody (with or without a TradeNAIRA.com Account) to initiate a payment resulting in the issuance or transfer of E-money to your Account. By integrating into your online checkout/platform any functionality intended to enable a payer without an Account to send a payment to your Account, you agree to all further terms of use of that functionality which TradeNAIRA.com will make available to you on any page on the TradeNAIRA.com.</p>
				    <ol>
				    	<li><b>Lifting your receiving limit</b></li>
				    	<p>If you have a receiving limit on your Account, you can view it by logging into your Account and clicking on the “View your account limits” link on the “Account Overview”. We may, at our reasonable discretion (for example, without limitation, to limit fraud or credit risk), impose limits on the amount of money you can receive through our Service. To lift your receiving limit, you must follow the steps that we will notify to you or publish from time to time (which we may set out in your Account Overview).</p>
				    	<li><b>Payment Review</b>
				    	<p> Payment Review is a process by which TradeNAIRA.com reviews certain potentially high-risk payment transactions. This may be because TradeNAIRA.com has the reasonable suspicion that a buyer’s Payment Instrument and/or Account are being used in relation to Restricted Activities (as set out in section 9) or for other reasons as determined by us in our reasonable discretion. If a payment is subject to Payment Review, TradeNAIRA.com will:</p>
				    	<ol>
				    		<ul>
				    			<li>execute the Payment Order initiated by the buyer;</li>
				    			<li>in TradeNAIRA.com’s discretion, immediately upon such execution restrict the buyer’s Payment Instrument;</li>
				    			<li>place a hold on the payment, meaning the funds are held in the seller’s Reserve Account;</li>
				    			<li>provide notice to the seller to delay the shipping of the item purchased by the buyer; and</li>
				    			<li>conduct its review of the payment.</li>
				    		</ul>
				    	</ol>
				    	<p>TradeNAIRA.com is not in possession of all the information necessary to place the funds at the seller’s disposal in the seller’s Payment Account until the Payment Review is complete and TradeNAIRA.com has found the payment to be in order. Where a Payment Review finds problem with the payment, the payment will be reversed and the funds returned to the buyer from the seller’s Reserve Account. All payments that complete Payment Review are still subject to being reversed under the terms of this Agreement but will be Seller Protection Eligible if they meet the Seller Protection Policy requirements. TradeNAIRA.com will provide notices to you by email and/or in the Transaction History tab of your TradeNAIRA.com account. A payment subject to Payment Review is a review of the payment only and is implemented to reduce the risk of TradeNAIRA.com users receiving high risk transactions. A payment subject to Payment Review is neither a review nor a representation by TradeNAIRA.com as to the commercial dealings, character or reputation of a party to the payment transaction and should not be considered as a lessening of the respect of any person</p>
				    	</li>
				    	
				    	<li><b>Risk of Reversals, Chargebacks and Claims</b></li>
				    	<p> The receipt of a payment into your TradeNAIRA.com Account does not equate to the receipt of cleared funds. A notification that E-money has been sent to you, does not amount to a receipt of E-money in your Account unless you have accepted the payment. You acknowledge and agree that a payment transaction is completed and received by you even if it becomes subject to a Reversal, Chargeback. Claim, Reserve or hold. When you receive a payment, you are liable to TradeNAIRA.com for the full amount of the payment plus any costs that we incur and any Fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason. In addition to any other liability, if there is a Reversal, or if you lose a Chargeback or Claim and you are not entitled to a payment under the Seller Protection Programme, you will owe TradeNAIRA.com an amount equal to the Reversal, Chargeback or Claim and our Fees per Schedule 1 (including a Chargeback Fee if applicable) and TradeNAIRA.com will debit your Balance to recover such an amount. If a sender of a payment files a Chargeback, the credit card company, not TradeNAIRA.com, will determine who wins the Chargeback. You can find out more about Chargebacks by reviewing our Chargeback Guide, accessible via the TradeNAIRA.com Security Centre and the section called: “Selling Safely”. The TradeNAIRA.com Security Centre is accessed via the TradeNAIRA.com website.</p>
				    	<li><b>TradeNAIRA.com and your customers.</b>
				    	<p>In representations or in public communications to your customers, you shall not mischaracterise or disparage TradeNAIRA.com as a payment method.
						If you enable your customers to pay you with TradeNAIRA.com, you shall treat TradeNAIRA.com’s payment mark at least at par with other payment methods offered.
						TradeNAIRA.com does not encourage surcharging because it is a commercial practice that can penalise the consumer and create unnecessary confusion, friction and abandonment at checkout. If you are a User resident in the UK, you shall not surcharge for the use of TradeNAIRA.com. Otherwise you agree that you will only surcharge for the use of TradeNAIRA.com in compliance with any law applicable to you and not in excess of the surcharges that you apply for the use of other payment methods. You further agree that if you do surcharge a buyer, you, and not TradeNAIRA.com, will inform the buyer of the requested charge. TradeNAIRA.com has no liability to any buyer where you have failed to inform the buyer of any surcharge. You acknowledge that you could be committing a criminal offence if you surcharge and/or fail to disclose any form of surcharge to a buyer.</p>
						<p>If you are a User resident in the UK and your Account has Merchant rate status and, at any of your points of sale (in whatever form), you:</p>
						<ol>
							<ul>
								<li>dissuade or inhibit your customers from using TradeNAIRA.com;</li>
								<li>fail to treat TradeNAIRA.com’s payment mark at least at par with other payment methods offered; or</li>
								<li>apply a surcharge for the use of TradeNAIRA.com,</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
						<p>TradeNAIRA.com may permanently downgrade your Account to the Standard rate (without prejudice to any other rights and remedies TradeNAIRA.com may have).</p>
				    	</li>
				    	<li><b>Receiving Money in different currencies.</b></li>
				    	<p> You do not need to maintain a Balance in a particular currency to accept payments sent in that currency. If you already maintain a Balance in the currency in which you receive a payment, we will credit all payments received in that currency to your Balance. Where you (not TradeNAIRA.com) offer a currency conversion at the point of sale, you will inform the buyer of the exchange rate and any charges that will be applied to the payment transaction. TradeNAIRA.com has no liability to any buyer if you fail to inform the buyer of the exchange rate and charges. You acknowledge that if you fail to disclose the exchange rate and charges to the buyer this may constitute a criminal offence by you.</p>
				    	<li><b>Taxes</b></li>
				    	<p>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and it is your responsibility to collect, report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.

TradeNAIRA.com and the merchant agree to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Laws applicable to controllers in respect of the provision of their respective services and otherwise in connection with this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, TradeNAIRA.com and the merchant each have their own, independently determined privacy policies, notices and procedures for the personal data they hold and are each a data controller (and not joint data controllers).In complying with the Data Protection Laws, TradeNAIRA.com and the merchant shall, without limitation:</p>

				    	<li><b>Holds according to your instructions.</b></li>
				    	<p>Certain TradeNAIRA.com functionality may allow you (whether directly or via someone you permit to act on your behalf under section 15.9a, like an online marketplace platform on which you transact as a seller) to instruct TradeNAIRA.com to hold your funds (including the proceeds of payments you receive using TradeNAIRA.com) in your Reserve Account. In such a case we will show you the availability status of those funds in your TradeNAIRA.com Balance – the status descriptions may differ according to the functionality you used to instruct us to place the hold. TradeNAIRA.com will release the hold on the funds according to the instruction that you (or the entity that you have permitted to act on your behalf under section 15.9a) give to TradeNAIRA.com, subject to the rest of this Agreement.</p>

				    <li>Withdrawing/Redeeming E- money
				    	<ol>
				    		<li><b>How to Withdraw/Redeem E-money</b>
				    		<p>You may withdraw funds by electronically transferring them to your bank account (this withdrawal/redemption functionality is sometimes known as “transfer to bank”). The bank account into which you request the redemption of E-money must be denominated in the original opening currency of your Account or another currency that TradeNAIRA.com supports for your country of residence. Balances will be redeemed in the original opening currency of your Account.</p>
				    		<p>This means that:</p>
				    			<ol>
				    				<ul>
				    					<li>
				    						If you withdraw a balance held in a currency other than the original opening currency of your Account, you will be charged a Currency Conversion Fee to convert it to your original opening currency balance.
				    					</li>
				    					<li>If you withdraw to a bank account or card held in a currency other than the original opening currency of your Account, you will be charged a Currency Conversion Fee for the conversion of the withdrawn currency amount into currency of your bank account or card. </li>
				    				</ul>
				    			</ol>
				    		</li>
				    		<li>
				    			<ol>
				    				<ul>
				    					<li><b>Withdrawal/Redemption Limits.</b></li>
				    					<p>You agree to comply with our requests to verify your identity before we redeem E-money to you to allow us to reduce the risk of fraud or to otherwise comply with our anti-money laundering or other legal obligations. You can view your periodic withdrawal limits, if any, by logging into your Account and clicking on the “View Limits” link on the “Account Overview.” We may, at our reasonable discretion (for example, without limitation, to limit fraud or credit risk), impose limits on the amount of money you can withdraw through our Service.</p>
				    					<li><b>Execution methods and timeframes.</b>
				    					<ol>
				    						<ul>
				    							<li><b>General</b></li>
				    							<p>Redemption transactions from your Payment Account will be executed within the timeframes set out in section 4.1.</p>
				    							<li><b>Redemptions/withdrawals to UK bank accounts</b></li>
				    							<p>We will use the Faster Payments Service to process a redemption/withdrawal Payment Order (pursuant to section 4.1) where</p>
				    							<ol>
				    								<ul>
				    									<li>
				    									the payment is made to your UK bank account in Pounds Sterling;
				    									</li>
				    									<li> the receiving institution can receive the payment via the Faster Payments Service; and</li>
				    									<li>
				    										the payment amount is within the limits stipulated by the Faster Payments Service from time to time
				    										<p>Redemption/withdrawal payments using the Faster Payments Service could (but are not guaranteed to) be credited to your bank account within 2 hours.</p>
				    									</li>
				    								</ul>
				    							</ol>
				    							<li><b> Transaction Review. </b></li>
				    							<p>We may review your withdrawal transaction to mitigate any risks and/or to prevent money laundering and to ascertain whether any Restricted Activity (as set out in section 9) is taking place (“Redemption Risk”). Where a Redemption Risk is identified by us, we reserve the right to restrict your Payment Instrument and/or refuse your Payment Order. When you instruct us to perform a redemption, we may treat this as a future dated Payment Order which we will execute within the timeframes set out in section 4.1 once we determine the Redemption Risk has passed. If we release the restriction and/or proceed to process your withdrawal, you agree that the date of your Payment Order will start on the Business Day the restriction was lifted.</p>

				    		<li><b>Withdrawing Money in Multiple Currencies</b></li>
				    		<p> If you have Balances in multiple currencies, you will be able to choose from those when you withdraw funds, but, unless otherwise agreed, the withdrawal will take place in the original opening currency of your Account. If you are able to withdraw to your branded MasterCard or Visa card, your withdrawal may be subject to a fee as stated in Schedule 1 of this Agreement and may take place in a different currency to your original opening currency depending on whether TradeNAIRA.com can support the withdrawal into the card’s base currency.

				    <p>You can close your Account at any time by logging into your Account, and send us a message requesting to close your account.</p>
				    <p>We may close your Account at our convenience by providing you with two months’ prior notice. We may also close your Account at any time where:</p>

					<li> <b>Fees and Currency Conversion</b>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Fees</b></li>
						<p>Fees for Users registered in the UK and Relevant Countries are set out in Schedule 1 below.</p>
						<p>For the avoidance of doubt, a User with a TradeNAIRA.com Account not registered in the UK or Relevant Countries will be liable to TradeNAIRA.com for the fees as set out in the terms of the User Agreement applicable to the country where the User is registered or as set out in the Fee Table accessible via the “footer” of each page of the TradeNAIRA.com website applicable to the country where the User is registered.</p>
						<p>If other Fees apply for services or functionalities not referred to in Schedule 1 below, you will be notified of those Fees on the TradeNAIRA.com Website(s) where those other services or functionalities are offered or provided.</p>
						<li><b>Currency Conversion</b></li>
						<p>Where a currency conversion is required, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange. </p>
						<p>The transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a Currency Conversion Fee applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion. The base exchange rate is set: on the basis of rates within the wholesale currency markets; or, if required by law or regulation, at the relevant government reference rate(s); in each case on the conversion date or the prior business day. </p>
						<p>The transaction exchange rate applicable to your conversion may be applied immediately and without notice to you.  </p>
						<p>The “Currency Converter” tool can be accessed through your Account and used to see what transaction exchange rates apply for certain currency exchanges at the time you use the tool.</p>
						<p>Where a currency conversion is offered by TradeNAIRA.com to you when you make your transaction (e.g. at the point of sale), you will be shown the transaction exchange rate that will be applied to the transaction before you proceed with authorising the payment transaction. By proceeding with your authorisation of the payment transaction you are agreeing to the currency conversion on the basis of the transaction exchange rate shown.</p>
						<p>Where your payment is funded by a Debit or Credit Card and involves a currency conversion by TradeNAIRA.com, by entering into this Agreement you consent to and authorise TradeNAIRA.com to convert the currency in place of your Credit or Debit card issuer.</p>
						<p>Depending on the country you reside in and the type of Funding Source used for your payment, you may opt out of a currency conversion by TradeNAIRA.com before you complete your payment during checkout, in which case TradeNAIRA.com has no liability to you for your use of other currency conversion options.</p>
						<p>Where a currency conversion is offered at the point of sale by the merchant, not by TradeNAIRA.com, and you choose to authorise the payment transaction on the basis of the merchant's exchange rate and charges, TradeNAIRA.com has no liability to you for that currency conversion.</p>
						<p>If you receive a payment in a currency other than the primary currency of your Account from anyone who doesn’t have a TradeNAIRA.com Account, the payment amount will be converted into the primary currency of your Account by TradeNAIRA.com for you at the time the payment is made, in accordance with this section 8.2 (except where otherwise agreed by TradeNAIRA.com) and you agree to bear the Currency Conversion Fee at section A3.1.1 of Schedule 1 of this Agreement (which is included in the transaction exchange rate you pay), before any other transaction fees apply.</p>

							</ul>
						</ol>
						</li>
						<li><b>Restricted Activities and Permissions.</b></li>
						<p>Nothing in this section 9 prevents you from permitting third parties to take certain actions on your behalf as outlined in section 15.9 in compliance with the conditions of their licence and applicable law.</p>
					</ol>
					</li>

					<li><b>Your Liability – Actions We May Take</b>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<b>Your Liability.</b>
							<ol>
								<ul>
									<li>You are responsible for all Reversals, Chargebacks, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by TradeNAIRA.com, a TradeNAIRA.com User, or a third party caused by your use of the Services and/or arising from your breach of this Agreement. You agree to reimburse TradeNAIRA.com, a User, or a third party for any and all such liability.</li>
									<li><b>Liability for Claims under TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection. </b> Notwithstanding any other section of this Agreement, if TradeNAIRA.com makes a final decision that you lose a Claim filed directly with TradeNAIRA.com, you will be required to reimburse TradeNAIRA.com for your liability. Your liability will include the full purchase price of the item and original postage costs (and in some cases, you may not receive the item back). TradeNAIRA.com Seller Protection may cover your liability, see section 11 below.</li>
									<li><b>Reimbursement for Your Liability.</b>
										 In the event you are liable for any amounts owed to TradeNAIRA.com, TradeNAIRA.com may immediately remove such amounts from your Balance (if available). If there are insufficient funds in your Balance to cover your liability, TradeNAIRA.com reserves the right to collect your debt to TradeNAIRA.com by using any payments received in your Account and otherwise you agree to reimburse TradeNAIRA.com through other means. TradeNAIRA.com may also recover amounts you owe us through legal means, including, without limitation, through the use of a debt collection agency.
									</li>
									<li><b>Temporary Holds for Disputed Transactions.</b> If a buyer files a Claim, Chargeback or Reversal on a payment you received, TradeNAIRA.com will place a temporary hold on the funds in your Account to cover the full amount of the Claim, Chargeback or Reversal. A hold placed under this provision will not restrict your use of the Account with regard to funds other than those disputed or at risk under the Claim, Chargeback or Reversal, unless we have another reason for doing so. If you win the dispute or if the payment is eligible for a payment under the terms of TradeNAIRA.com Seller Protection, we will release the hold and restore your access to the applicable funds. If you lose the dispute, TradeNAIRA.com will remove the applicable funds from your Account.</li>
								</ul>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li><b>Actions by TradeNAIRA.com</b>
						<p>If we have reason to believe that you have engaged in any Restricted Activities, we may take various actions to protect TradeNAIRA.com, a User, a third party, or you from Reversals, Chargebacks, Claims, fees, fines, penalties and any other liability. The actions we may take include but are not limited to the following:</p>
						<ol>
							<ul>
								<li>
									 We may, at any time and without liability, suspend, block, limit, close or cancel your right to use your Payment Instrument or Account entirely or for any particular transaction, which may in turn suspend, block, limit, close or cancel access to your Account or the Services (such as limiting access to any of your Funding Sources, and your ability to send money, make withdrawals, or remove financial Information). We will normally give you advance notice of any suspension or cancellation but we may, if it is reasonable to do so (for example if you are in breach of this Agreement or we consider it advisable for security reasons), suspend or cancel your right to use your Payment Instrument or Account without prior notice to you;
								</li>
								<li>Block your Account and/or hold any funds in the Reserve Account (including, without limitation, for more than 180 days if so required by TradeNAIRA.com, where TradeNAIRA.com’s rights under section 10.2 arise from your engagement in the Restricted Activity set out in section 9.1 ag.);</li>
								<li>Refuse any particular payment transaction at any time for any reason and will only be required to make available the fact of the refusal and the reasons for the refusal and how you may resolve the problem, where possible, upon request and provided it is not prohibited by law;</li>
								<li><b>We may reverse a payment</b> (including, if appropriate, to the sender’s Funding Source), that violates our Acceptable Use Policy or section 9, or which we reasonably suspect of violating our Acceptable Use Policy or section 9;</li>
								<li>We may request information from you or otherwise update inaccurate Information you provided us;</li>
								<li>We may refuse to provide our Services to you in the future;</li>
								<li> We may hold your funds to the extent and for so long as reasonably needed to protect against the risk of liability. You acknowledge that, as a non-exhaustive guide:
								<ol>
									<ul>
										<li>TradeNAIRA.com’s risk of liability in respect of card-funded payments that you receive can last until the risk of a Chargeback closing in favour of the payer/buyer (as determined by card scheme rules) has passed. This depends on certain factors, including, without limitation:
										<ol>
											<ul>
												<li>The type of goods or services for which you receive payment; or</li>
												<li>The timeframe for delivery of the goods or performance of the services for which you receive payment (e.g. sales of event tickets months in advance of the event date can present a higher and more enduring risk of Chargebacks than sales of most other items or services);</li>
											</ul>
										</ol>
										</li>
										<li>TradeNAIRA.com’s risk of liability in respect of a Claim or Dispute arising from a payment that you receive can last for the time that it takes for the parties to close the Claim or Dispute and all appeals associated with that Claim or Dispute in accordance with section 13 of this Agreement;</li>
										<li>TradeNAIRA.com’s risk of liability in respect of any event of insolvency that you suffer can last for as long as and to the extent that laws applicable to your insolvency restrict TradeNAIRA.com from taking legal action against you; and</li>
										<li>If you allow your Account to have a balance reflecting an amount owing to TradeNAIRA.com, TradeNAIRA.com’s risk of liability can last for the time and to the extent that you owe that amount to TradeNAIRA.com.</li>
									</ul>
								</ol>



								</li>
								<li>We may take legal action against you.
								<ol>
									<ul>
										<li> We may suspend your eligibility for TradeNAIRA.com seller protection and/or TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection (including in retrospect).</li>
										<li>aWe may suspend, limit or terminate your access to our Services, websites, software, systems (including any networks and servers used to provide any of the Services) operated by us or on our behalf, and, to the extent and for so long as permitted by applicable law, your data.</li>
									</ul>
								</ol>
								<p>Unless otherwise directed by us, you must not use or attempt to use your Payment Instrument or Account while it is suspended or has been closed. You must ensure that all agreements with merchants or other third parties that involve third party initiated payments (including, Pre-approved Payments) set up from your Account are cancelled immediately upon the termination, suspension or closure of your Account. You remain liable under this Agreement in respect of all charges and other amounts incurred through the use of your Account at any time, irrespective of termination, suspension or closure.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
						</li>
						<li><b>Limited Access.</b>If we suspect that your Account has been accessed without your authorisation, we may suspend, or limit, your access to your Account or the Services (such as limiting access to any of your Funding Sources, and your ability to send money, make withdrawals, or remove financial Information). If we limit access to your Account, we will provide you with notice and opportunity to request restoration of access if appropriate.</li>
						<li><b>Reserves</b>TradeNAIRA.com, in its sole discretion, may place a Reserve on funds held in your Account when TradeNAIRA.com reasonably believes (based on the information available to TradeNAIRA.com at the time of taking the Reserve and what in its sole discretion it regards as an acceptable level of risk to TradeNAIRA.com under all the circumstances) there may be a higher than acceptable level of risk associated with your Account. If TradeNAIRA.com places a Reserve on funds in your Account, the funds will be held in your Reserve Account and those funds will be shown as “pending” in your TradeNAIRA.com Balance. If your Account is subject to a Reserve, TradeNAIRA.com will provide you with a notice specifying the terms of the Reserve. The terms may require that a certain percentage of the amounts received into your Account are held for a certain period of time, or that a certain amount of money is held in reserve, or anything else that TradeNAIRA.com determines is necessary to protect against the risk associated with your Account. TradeNAIRA.com may change the terms of the Reserve at any time by providing you with notice of the new terms. You may close your Account if you object to the Reserve. If your Account is closed for any reason, we have the right to hold the Reserve for up to 180 Days. When managing risk for Accounts, we may also limit the amount you can immediately withdraw or change the speed or the method of payment for withdrawals, set-off amounts from your Balance and/or require that you, or a person associated with you, enter into other forms of security arrangements with us (for example, by providing a guarantee or requiring you to deposit funds with us as security for your obligations to us or third parties). You also agree to undertake, at your own expense, any further action (including, without limitation, executing any necessary documents and registering any form of document reasonably required by us to allow us to perfect any form of security interest or otherwise) required to establish a Reserve or other form of security in a manner reasonably determined by us.</li>
						<li><b>Payment Hold</b>
						<ol>
							<ul>
								<li>You agree that if either:
								<ol>
									<ul>
										<li>you receive a payment that involves Transaction Risk; or</li>
										<li>there may be a higher than acceptable level of risk or exposure associated with your Account (based on the information available to TradeNAIRA.com at the relevant time and what in its sole discretion it regards as an acceptable level of risk or exposure to TradeNAIRA.com, its customers and/or its service providers under all the circumstances).
										<p>TradeNAIRA.com may in its sole discretion (acting reasonably) place a hold on that or any payment. If TradeNAIRA.com places a hold on funds in your Account, we will notify you about it (including, without limitation, how long the hold may last) - the funds will be held in your Reserve Account and those funds will be shown as “pending” in your TradeNAIRA.com Balance. We may notify you about the hold through authorised third parties (such as partner platforms on which you transact).</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</ol>
								</li>
								<li>TradeNAIRA.com will release the hold made on your payment under this provision when TradeNAIRA.com determines that the Transaction Risk or risk or exposure associated with your Account no longer exists. Please note that, notwithstanding the above, if you receive a Dispute, Claim, Chargeback, or Reversal on the transaction payment subject to the hold, the funds (or an amount equal to the relevant payment) may be held in your Reserve Account until the matter is resolved pursuant to this Agreement.</li>
								<li>You agree to provide to TradeNAIRA.com any information as TradeNAIRA.com may reasonably request to allow TradeNAIRA.com to determine whether the Transaction Risk or risk or exposure to your Account has passed. You may close your Account if you object to the hold under this provision. If your Account is closed for any reason, TradeNAIRA.com has the right to hold a payment under this provision for a period of up to 180 days from the date the complete obligations under the contract for sale (to which the payment in question relates) have been discharged.</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
						</li>
						<li><b>Information about you</b>
						<ol>
							<ul>
								<li>TradeNAIRA.com reserves the right to request additional information from you, other than what is referred to in this Agreement, to allow it to comply with its anti-money laundering obligations.

This may include, without limitation, requiring you to fax, email or otherwise provide to us certain identification documents. You also agree to provide us, upon our reasonable request and at your own expense, information about your finance and operations, including, without limitation, your most recent financial statements (certified or otherwise) and merchant processing statements (if applicable).</li>

								<b>Identifying Errors and/or Unauthorised Transactions.</b>
								<p>You can inspect your transaction history at any time by logging in to your Account on the TradeNAIRA.com website and clicking the "History" tab. It is very important that you immediately notify TradeNAIRA.com if you have reason to believe any of the following activities have occurred: (i) there has been an unauthorised transaction sent from your Account; (ii) there has been unauthorised access to your Account; (iii) your password or PIN has been compromised; (iv) any device you have used to access the Services has been lost, stolen or deactivated, or (v) someone has transferred or may have transferred money from your Account without your permission (this includes where you link your Account with a third party platform (including a site or app) to initiate payments via that platform, but a payment was made from your Account for a transaction via that platform that you did not make) (collectively called <b>“Improper Account Access”</b>). You must also immediately notify us if you have reason to believe that any other error has occurred on your Account.<b> In order for you to notify TradeNAIRA.com immediately of any of the above events, we strongly recommend that you monitor your Account closely on a regular basis.</b>We will not seek to hold you liable for any unauthorised use of your Account by any person provided that we are satisfied that you have not acted deliberately so as to enable any third person to gain access to your TradeNAIRA.com ID and/or password/PIN or to your device while you are logged into the Services. We will hold you liable for unauthorised use of your Account if we have evidence that suggests: you acted deliberately so as to enable any third person to gain access to your TradeNAIRA.com ID and/or password/PIN; you acted fraudulently; or you have with intent or gross negligence failed to comply with your obligations to use your Payment Instrument in the manner set out in this Agreement.</p>
							</li>
							<li><b>Notifying TradeNAIRA.com of Errors, Unauthorised Transactions and/or misappropriated or unauthorised use of your Payment Instrument.</b> You must notify us if you believe there has been or will be an error, unauthorised transaction, misappropriated or unauthorised use of your Payment Instrument or your Account, by telephoning TradeNAIRA.com Customer Service at the telephone number shown on the TradeNAIRA.com website(s) or writing us at support@tradenaira.com. You must give us all the information in your possession as to the circumstances of any errors, unauthorised transactions and/or misappropriated or unauthorised use of your Payment Instrument or Account and take all reasonable steps requested to assist TradeNAIRA.com in its investigation. We may provide third parties with information we consider relevant in such circumstances in accordance with our Privacy Policy (alternatively known as our Privacy Statement).</li>
							<li><b>Review of Reports of Errors.</b> Without prejudice to your statutory rights, we will advise you of the results of our investigation within 20 Business Days after we receive your notice. If we have made an error, we will correct it promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 60 Days to investigate your query. If we decide that we need more time, we may provisionally re-credit your Account for the amount you think is in error within ten Business Days after we receive your notice; so that you will have use of the E-money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If you initially provided information to us via the telephone and we do not receive your query in writing within ten Business Days after your oral notice, we will not provisionally re-credit your Account.
							<p>At the end of our investigation, we will advise you of the results within three Business Days. If we determine that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation and we may debit any provisional credit that we previously credited to you in relation to the alleged error. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation (and this will not attract the Records Request Fee set out in Schedule 1).</p>
							</li>
							<li><b>Liability for Unauthorised Transactions. </b>Without prejudice to your statutory rights, if you report that there has been an Improper Account Access related to your Account, and there is no evidence to suggest fraud or deliberate or grossly negligent behaviour by you, we will reimburse you in full for all unauthorised transactions sent from your Account provided that you have informed us of the Improper Account Access without undue delay and in any event, no later than 13 months after the first transaction arising from that Improper Account Access was executed. Where we believe in our reasonable opinion that further investigation is required to ascertain more clearly the circumstances surrounding the reported Improper Account Access, we will follow the same process as set out in section 12.3 above for such investigation</li>
							<li><b>Errors.</b> If we discover a processing error, we will rectify the error. If the error resulted in your receiving less money than you were entitled to, TradeNAIRA.com will credit your Account for the difference. If the error results in you receiving more money than you were entitled to, TradeNAIRA.com may debit the extra funds from your Account. If a payment was made to your Funding Source by way of mistake, TradeNAIRA.com may correct the mistake by debiting or crediting (as the case may be) your appropriate Funding Source(s). If the error resulted in our not completing a transaction on time or in the correct amount, we will be liable to refund any amount as a result of carrying out a defective or non-executed payment transaction and for your losses or damages directly and reasonably foreseeably caused by this failure, unless:

							<ol>
								<ul>
									<li>through no fault of ours, you did not have enough available funds to complete the transaction,</li>
									<li>our system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction, or</li>
									<li>circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood or loss of Internet connection) prevented the transaction, despite our reasonable precautions.</li>
								</ul>
							</ol>
							<p>Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement, TradeNAIRA.com will not be held liable for the non-execution or defective execution of a payment transaction  if you have failed to notify TradeNAIRA.com about the issue without undue delay after becoming aware of the issue or in any event within 13 months after the debit date of the payment transaction.</p>

The final decision may result in TradeNAIRA.com reimbursing the buyer for the amount of the payment made through TradeNAIRA.com for the purchase (up to the full price of the purchase and (where applicable) original postage costs) and the Payment Recipient bearing liability to TradeNAIRA.com for that reimbursement.</p>
						<p>TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection is neither a product warranty nor a service warranty. No guarantees are given. TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection does not affect your statutory rights against the Payment Recipient. Please also consider section 13.2 below (Is TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection right for me?).</p>
						<p>If you are a Payment Recipient, your liability under TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection may be covered by the Seller Protection Programme (please see section 11 for more details). Sometimes we may be able (but shall not be obliged) to waive your liability for the reimbursement for other reasons (at our full and sole discretion).</p>
						<p>Whether you are the buyer or Payment Recipient, you acknowledge that the Services may be used as a method of payment for a wide and complex variety of types of purchases, both online and offline. Accordingly and notwithstanding anything otherwise in this Agreement, you agree that TradeNAIRA.com may (but shall not be obliged to) at any time and for any reason at its full and sole discretion and without liability:</p>
						<ol>
							<ul>
								<li>make a final decision on any problem with a purchase raised by a buyer with a TradeNAIRA.com account registered anywhere in the world (whether under the TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection policy or User Agreement of the country of registration of that buyer’s TradeNAIRA.com Account or otherwise) in favour of the buyer or the Payment Recipient. The final decision will always be communicated in writing (which may be by email). In the event that TradeNAIRA.com makes a final decision on the problem in favour of the buyer or Payment Recipient, each party must comply with TradeNAIRA.com’s final decision; and</li>
								<li>waive the terms and conditions of coverage under TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection (whether stated in this Agreement or otherwise, including, without limitation, the conditions of reimbursement at section 13.4) at any time and for any reason, for the purpose of facilitating the resolution of any problem raised by a buyer relating to a purchase paid for using TradeNAIRA.com. As a non-exhaustive guide, this may include allowing reimbursement for Disputes or Claims raised outside of the timeframes set out in section 13.5 for certain purchases (typically purchases agreed to be delivered or performed outside of the timeframe set out in section 13.5), where we have reason to believe that the buyer did not have a reasonable opportunity within that timeframe to determine that there was a problem with that purchase.</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
						<p>TradeNAIRA.com is not obliged to reimburse you for any costs that you incur to comply with any of TradeNAIRA.com’s requests for cooperation for the purpose of resolving the problem (including, without limitation, costs that you incur to return a SNAD item to the Payment Recipient or another party as TradeNAIRA.com requests), although sometimes it may reimburse these costs.</p>
						<li><b>Is TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection right for me?</b>
						<p>The outcome of any decision made by TradeNAIRA.com under TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection might not always be suitable for your particular needs and you should carefully read this section 13 and consider your options before using TradeNAIRA.com to resolve a problem.</p>
						<p>If TradeNAIRA.com is contacted to resolve a problem, TradeNAIRA.com may require you to take an irreversible action to resolve the problem, which might make it no longer practicable in the circumstances for you to resolve the problem in another way. For example, TradeNAIRA.com may require you to return the item to the Payment Recipient under section 13.6.</p>
						<p>It may be more suitable for your particular needs and prospects to resolve your problem without involving TradeNAIRA.com. Below is a non-exhaustive list of ways of resolving your problem without involving TradeNAIRA.com.</p>
						<ol>
							<ul>
								<li><b> Resolve the problem directly with the Payment Recipient:</b> Before contacting TradeNAIRA.com about a problem, you should contact the Payment Recipient directly to resolve the problem in accordance with the Payment Recipient’s return policy (if any) as stated on their sales listing, website or other sales literature. If you do this:</li>
								<li>the conditions for reimbursement at section 13.4 will still apply (including, without limitation, the timeframe for raising a Dispute set out in section 13.5b). <b>It is your responsibility to keep track of these deadlines;</b> and</li>
								<li>there is a risk that the Payment Recipient may require you to take certain actions that could cause you to fail to meet the conditions for reimbursement at section 13.4 (for instance, if (whether as part of the Payment Recipient’s return policy or otherwise) the Payment Recipient directs you (and you proceed) to post an item that you purchased to an address that does not correspond with our record of the Payment Recipient’s address, we may determine that you have not posted the item back to the Payment Recipient in compliance with section 13.6).
								<p>If you are a Payment Recipient, as you may be liable for any reimbursement made by TradeNAIRA.com to the buyer, you acknowledge that it is in your interests to resolve directly with the buyer any problem with a purchase paid for through TradeNAIRA.com.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>aPursue your card chargeback rights: You may pursue your chargeback rights with your card company or card issuer (if they apply), but if you do so at the same time as pursuing the resolution of your problem (whether through a Claim or Dispute) under TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection or if you seek a double recovery, TradeNAIRA.com may close your Dispute or Claim and/or hold you liable for the amount you have been reimbursed under TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection, and you will have to rely solely on your chargeback rights.</li>
								</ul>
								</li>
								<p>Whichever way you attempt to resolve your problem, it may involve you taking an irreversible action, which could harm your prospects of resolving your problem in another way, so please consider your options carefully.</p>
							</ul>
						</ol>
						<li><b>What happens when TradeNAIRA.com makes a final decision in favour of the buyer…If am a buyer? </b>
						<p>If TradeNAIRA.com makes a final decision on your problem (including, without limitation, a Dispute or a Claim) in your favour, TradeNAIRA.com may (but shall not be obliged to) reimburse you for the amount of the payment made through TradeNAIRA.com for the purchase (up to the full price of the purchase and (where applicable) original postage costs). Please see section 13.4 (Conditions for reimbursement) for details of the conditions of reimbursement.</p>
						<p><b>If I am a Payment Recipient?</b> If TradeNAIRA.com makes a final decision on the buyer’s problem in the buyer’s favour, you will be liable to TradeNAIRA.com for the amount that TradeNAIRA.com may reimburse to the buyer. TradeNAIRA.com shall not be obliged to refund your TradeNAIRA.com fees associated with the transaction or any other fees charged from your TradeNAIRA.com account by a third party associated with the transaction (such as the fees charged by a third party platform on which you make your sale). In some cases (for instance, if you lose a SNAD Claim because TradeNAIRA.com has reason to believe that the item you sold is counterfeit) you might not receive the item back (for instance, a competent authority may take control and/or possession of the item or it may be otherwise irreversibly dealt with).</p>

						</li>
						<li> <b>Conditions for reimbursement</b>
						<p>You may be reimbursed under TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection for a problem with a purchase only if all of the following requirements are met:</p>

								<li><b>You sent the payment for your purchase from your TradeNAIRA.com Account</b> to the Payment Recipient’s TradeNAIRA.com Account through the Send Money tab applicable to payments for goods and/or services on the TradeNAIRA.com website or app, or the Payment Recipient's TradeNAIRA.com checkout flow (including, without limitation, the TradeNAIRA.com Location Based Payments Functionality, if used by the Payment Recipient).</li>
								<li><b>Your problem is </b>either that:
								<ol>
									<ul>
										<li>you did not receive your purchase– “Not Received” (<b>“NR”</b>); or</li>
										<li>your purchase is “Significantly Not as Described” (“SNAD”). Further information on what we mean by “SNAD” is set out in section 13.8.</li>
									</ul>
								</ol>
								</li>
								<li><b>You have followed the process</b>described in section 13.5 (How do I resolve my problem?).</li>
								<li><b>You have not received </b>a recovery for that purchase from another source.</li>
								<li><b>Your eligibility is not otherwise suspended.</b></li>
								<li><b>g. TradeNAIRA.com has made a final decision</b>on your problem in your favour.</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
						<li><b>How do I resolve my problem?</b>
						<ol>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<b>Try to resolve your problem directly with the Payment Recipient</b>
									<p>Use reasonable endeavours to resolve the problem directly with the Payment Recipient. If you are <b>still</b>unable to resolve the problem, go to the Resolution Centre and follow steps b, c and d.</p>
								</li>
								<li><b>Open a Dispute</b>
								<p>Open a Dispute within <b>180 days</b> of the date on which you made the payment for the purchase you would like to dispute. We may refuse to accept any Dispute that you open in relation to that purchase after the expiry of that period (please be aware of this if you agree a delivery time of an item or performance of a service with the Payment Recipient that falls after the expiry of that period).</p>
								</li>
								<li><b>Escalate the Dispute to a Claim</b>
								<p>If you and the Payment Recipient are unable to come to an agreement, escalate the Dispute to a Claim <b>within 20 days</b> of opening the Dispute. <b>It is your responsibility to keep track of these deadlines.</b>You must wait at least 7 days from the date of payment to escalate a Dispute for a purchase Not Received (NR), unless otherwise stated by TradeNAIRA.com..</p>
								<p>If you do not escalate the Dispute to a Claim within 20 days, TradeNAIRA.com may close the Dispute and you will not be eligible for a payment under the terms of TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection.</p>
								<p>In certain cases, TradeNAIRA.com may permit you to edit or change a Claim after filing only if you wish to add further information or if you wish to change the reason of your Dispute/Claim from “Not Received” to “Significantly Not as Described”. Otherwise you may not edit or change a Claim after filing it</p>
								</li>
								<li><b>Respond to TradeNAIRA.com’s requests in a timely manner</b>
								<p>Once a Dispute has been escalated to a Claim, TradeNAIRA.com may make a final decision on your problem in favour of the buyer or the Payment Recipient. Before (and for the purpose of) making a final decision on your problem, TradeNAIRA.com may request your cooperation in resolving the problem under section 13.6.</p>
								</li>

							</ul>
						</ol>
						<li><b>Cooperating with TradeNAIRA.com to resolve the problem</b>
						<p>Whether you are the buyer or the Payment Recipient, for the purpose of resolving the problem, TradeNAIRA.com may request and require you to (and you shall in a timely manner): (i) provide documentary evidence (at your own expense, unless TradeNAIRA.com agrees otherwise) to support your position (including, without limitation, proof of delivery, receipts, third party evaluations and police reports); and (ii) take any other action that TradeNAIRA.com specifies. If you refuse to comply with TradeNAIRA.com’s requests, TradeNAIRA.com may make a final decision in favour of the other party.</p>
						<p>As a non-exhaustive guide, TradeNAIRA.com may request and require:</p>
						<ol>
							<ul>
							<li>
								the buyer to post back to the Payment Recipient, to TradeNAIRA.com or to a third party (as TradeNAIRA.com may direct) an item that the buyer claims is SNAD and to provide Proof of Delivery (as set out in section 11.9 above). Please take reasonable precautions in re-packing the item to reduce the risk of damage to the item during transit.
							</li>
							<li>the Payment Recipient to accept back the item sent to it by the buyer and refund the buyer the full purchase price plus original postage costs. If the Payment Recipient refuses to accept an item sent back to the Payment Recipient by the buyer at TradeNAIRA.com’s direction), TradeNAIRA.com may award the Claim in favour of the buyer, provided the buyer has provided satisfactory evidence to TradeNAIRA.com that the item was sent to the Payment Recipient at an address supplied to the buyer by TradeNAIRA.com during the Claim process.</li>
							<li>the buyer to reasonably cooperate with TradeNAIRA.com to ensure the proper and safe disposal of an item and to provide evidence of its disposal.</li>
							<li>the Payment Recipient to present evidence to TradeNAIRA.com in a timely manner that the Payment Recipient delivered to/performed for the buyer the purchase as agreed with the buyer, even where the purchase is not eligible for TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection under section 13.4.a. If the Payment Recipient does not present such evidence in a timely manner, TradeNAIRA.com may find in favour of the buyer. If the Payment Recipient presents such evidence in a timely manner, TradeNAIRA.com may find in favour of the Payment Recipient even if the buyer claims to have not received the purchase.</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
						<p>If TradeNAIRA.com has reason to believe that returning an item that the buyer claims is SNAD to the Payment Recipient would result in a violation of applicable law, such as laws related to handling counterfeit items, TradeNAIRA.com may report the item to a competent authority. This may result in the authority taking control of and/or possession of the item from the buyer and the Payment Recipient might not receive the item back.</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>What if my purchase is not eligible for re-imbursement under TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection?</b>
						<p>You may also look to resolve a problem directly with the Payment Recipient by filing a dispute through the TradeNAIRA.com Resolution Centre. To do so, <b>you must file a Dispute in the TradeNAIRA.com Resolution Centre within 180 days of the date on which you sent the payment.</b> Once you have done so, you should attempt to resolve the Dispute directly with the Payment Recipient. If your payment is not eligible under TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection, TradeNAIRA.com is not obliged to make a decision on the Claim.</p>
						</li>
						<li><b> What is Significantly Not as Described (SNAD)?</b>
						<ol>
							<ul>
								<li>Your purchase is Significantly Not as Described if it is materially different from the last description of it that you received from the Payment Recipient before you paid for it (which, for exclusively online purchases, shall be taken to be the Payment Recipient’s description of the purchase in the relevant online listing) (“<b>Purchase Description</b>”). Here are some non-exhaustive examples:
								<ol>
									<ul>
										<li>
											You received a completely different item. For instance, you purchased a book and received a DVD or an empty box or the software that you received was not the software that was sold to you.
										</li>
										<li>The condition of your purchase was misrepresented. For instance, the listing for an item said “new” and the item was used.</li>
										<li>Your purchase was advertised as authentic but is not authentic.</li>
										<li>Your purchase is missing major parts or features and the fact that these parts or features are missing was not disclosed in the listing.</li>
										<li>You purchased 3 items from a Payment Recipient but received only 2.</li>
										<li>Your purchase was damaged during postage.</li>
									</ul>
								</ol>
								</li>
								<li>Your purchase is not Significantly Not as Described (SNAD) if it is not materially different from the Purchase Description. Here are some non-exhaustive examples:
								<ol>
									<ul>
										<li>
											The defect in your purchase was correctly described by the Payment Recipient.
										</li>
										<li>Your purchase was correctly described but you didn't want it after you received it.</li>
										<li>Your purchase was correctly described but did not meet your expectations.</li>
										<li>The item that you purchased has minor scratches and was listed as used condition.</li>
										<li>An event you purchased tickets to was postponed.</li>
									</ul>
								</ol>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
						</li>
					<li><b>Assumption of rights</b>
					<p>If TradeNAIRA.com pays out a Claim, Reversal or Chargeback that you file against a recipient of your payment, you agree to transfer and allow TradeNAIRA.com to have your rights, benefits and remedies against the recipient of your payment. This is known in legal terms for you to agree to “subrogate” or otherwise “assign” to TradeNAIRA.com your rights against the recipient and third parties related to the payment, and agree that we may pursue those rights, benefits and remedies directly or on your behalf, in TradeNAIRA.com’s discretion.</p>
					</li>
					<li><b>No Double Recovery</b>
					<p>You may not receive a recovery for a purchase under TradeNAIRA.com Buyer Protection if you additionally receive a recovery for that purchase directly from the Payment Recipient or another third party.</p>
					</li>
					<li><b>Event tickets</b>
						<p>In certain cases, if you purchase a ticket or pay for the right to attend an event from a Payment Recipient who is a UK registered TradeNAIRA.com Account holder (“<b>Event</b>”), all monies paid by you may be held by TradeNAIRA.com on trust for you, so that the beneficial interest in such monies remains with you until the performance of the Event in question.</p>

						 <p><b><h4>General Conditions of Use - </h4></b>If you arrive at the Site through entities linked and/or integrated with TradeNAIRA.com or otherwise by or through a third party (e.g., an auction, exchange, or Internet-based intermediary that hosts electronic marketplaces and mediates transactions among businesses), then you authorize such third party to transfer relevant data to TradeNAIRA.com to facilitate the Transaction.

The party entering into this Agreement on behalf of any User represents and warrants that he/she is authorized to do so and to bind the User and is a natural person of at least eighteen (18) years of age. In order to initiate and commence a Transaction, all Users to a Transaction must register at the Site, agree to all terms in the General Escrow Instructions and agree to the Transaction Escrow Instructions.</p>

						 <p><b><h4>Obligations of Sellers -</h4></b> On the Transaction Detail Screens, each Seller to a Transaction must designate an Account to which payment for the Transaction will be made. Each Seller authorizes IES and its authorized agents to initiate credit entries to such Seller's Account for payment of the purchase price, or applicable balance due, and to debit Seller's Account to discharge Seller's obligations. Each Seller in a Transaction shall deliver the items set forth in Transaction Detail Screens directly to the Buyer (or Buyers), at the address specified by such Buyer as shown on the TradeNAIRA.com website and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Transaction Escrow Instructions and General Escrow Instructions. Seller shall use a delivery service that provides a confirmation of delivery and Seller shall provide TradeNAIRA.com with a tracking or reference number for the shipment of the goods. Seller gives TradeNAIRA.com permission to act as its agent in communicating with the shipping company regarding the notice of the delivery of the goods. In the event TradeNAIRA.com does not receive notice of shipment from Seller within ten (10) calendar days of notification from TradeNAIRA.com's notice to Seller to ship the items, Seller authorizesTradeNAIRA.com to return the escrowed funds (excluding TradeNAIRA.com fees) to Buyer. In the event of a return of the items by Buyer, Seller shall notify TradeNAIRA.com of the receipt of the returned items. Upon receipt of such notice from Seller, the Seller's five (5) day inspection period shall commence. In the event Seller accepts the returned items within the inspection period or fails to act within the inspection period, TradeNAIRA.com shall remit the escrowed funds (excluding TradeNAIRA.com fees) to Buyer. If Seller notifies TradeNAIRA.com of its non-acceptance of any returned items within the Seller's inspection period, then TradeNAIRA.com will retain the escrow funds pending resolution of the dispute or take other action as authorized. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, if all Users to a Transaction agree on the Transaction Detail Screens that there is no shipping required, then no party hereto will have any obligation under this Agreement with respect to shipping.</p>

						 <p><b><h4>Obligations of Buyers -</h4></b> On the Transaction Detail Screens, Buyer must designate a payment mechanism and an Account from which the purchase price and related fees (unless such fees are to be paid by Seller) will be obtained for the deposit into escrow. Depending on the amount of the Transaction and the currency selected for the Transaction, Buyer may remit the necessary funds via various methods, which may include corporate credit card, charge card, debit card or purchasing card, check (cheque), cashier's check, money order, or wire transfer. In the case of wire transfers, Buyer will initiate the wire to an account designated by TradeNAIRA.com on or before the date set forth in the Transaction Detail Screens. Regardless of the payment method, Buyer authorizes TradeNAIRA.com and TradeNAIRA.com authorized agents to initiate credit or debit transactions, as applicable, to obtain the purchase price and fees due for a Transaction and to initiate any debit or credit entries or reversals, as the case may be, as may be necessary to correct any error in a payment or transfer and to discharge Buyer's obligations under Section 22 of this Agreement. TradeNAIRA.com will deposit funds received from Buyer into an escrow trust account maintained by TradeNAIRA.com (the "Escrow Account"). Unless otherwise requested as specified in the following sentence, escrowed deposits do not earn interest for Buyer or Seller. If you anticipate an extended closing of the Transaction, then you may request and approve an instruction to have TradeNAIRA.com place Buyer's funds into an interest bearing account for the benefit of Buyer or Seller. If interest is to accrue to the benefit of the Seller, then both Buyer and Seller must request and approve the establishment of the interest bearing account. If this request is made, then TradeNAIRA.com will charge the account of the party to whom the interest accrues an additional nonrefundable service charge of $100.00, which must be paid in advance.</p>

						 <p>Buyer shall notify TradeNAIRA.com of the receipt or non-receipt of the items on the date the merchandise is received or the Buyer Inspection Period is started. Buyer shall notify TradeNAIRA.com of the Buyer's acceptance or rejection of the items before the Buyer's Inspection Period expires. Upon receipt of notice from Buyer that the items have been received and accepted, TradeNAIRA.com shall transfer the payment amount (less any amount payable to TradeNAIRA.com for TradeNAIRA.com fees) to Seller's Account. Transfer to a Seller generally will be initiated within the next business day from the day on which notice of acceptance of the items is received from the Buyer.

Buyer shall follow the procedures set forth on the Site in the event the items are rejected.</p>

						 <p><b><h4>Obligations of Brokers -</h4></b> On the Transaction Detail Screens, each Broker to a Transaction must designate an Account to which the Broker Fee payment will be made. Each Broker authorizes IES and its authorized agents to initiate credit entries to such Broker's Account for payment of the Broker's commission, and to debit Broker's account to discharge Broker's obligations. Each Broker in a Transaction shall provide Buyer email, Seller email, and Transaction details including purchase price, merchandise description, inspection period and which party is responsible for the Broker and Escrow fees.</p>

If an alternate Escrow Agent is so designated, TradeNAIRA.com shall be discharged from TradeNAIRA.com duties under this Agreement, the General Escrow Instructions and the Transaction Escrow Instructions by delivering all escrowed funds to such person or entity.
